# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Scope

`sumlyzer` is intentionally narrow: **npm workspaces** running **`node:test`**.
Before proposing support for another package manager (pnpm, yarn) or another
test runner (Jest, Vitest, Mocha...), please open an issue to discuss it,
that's a significant expansion of scope, not a small patch.

## Setup

Requires Node.js >= 22 (native `styleText`, `Promise.withResolvers`).

```
git clone <your fork>
cd sumlyzer
```

There are no dependencies, so there's nothing to install.

## Running the tests

```
npm test
```

Try the CLI against a real npm workspaces project while you're at it:

```
node bin/sumlyzer.mjs --help
node /path/to/sumlyzer/bin/sumlyzer.mjs --ff
```

## Conventions

- Zero runtime dependencies as much as possible. Prefer a native Node.js API over adding a
  package.
- Keep `src/run.mjs` functions small and pure where possible, they're unit
  tested directly (`test/run.spec.mjs`), which only works if they don't
  depend on hidden state.
- Only export what `bin/sumlyzer.mjs` or the test suite actually import.
  Everything else stays internal (see `package.json`, which has no `main` /
  `exports`, the CLI is the only public surface).
- No comments explaining *what* code does, name things clearly instead.
  A comment is only worth it for a non-obvious *why*.

## Submitting changes

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your change, with a test if it changes behavior.
3. Make sure `npm test` passes.
4. Open a pull request describing the problem it solves.

## Reporting bugs

Please include: the command you ran, your Node version, and, if the bug is
about parsing test output, the relevant snippet of `node:test`'s output
that didn't parse as expected.
